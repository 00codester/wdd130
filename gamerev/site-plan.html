      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My project will be a website that reviews video games. 
        I want to create some videos that review games, 
        but also have articles showing pros and cons for the games reviewed. 
        The articles won’t just be transcribed videos, 
        they will be written in a 5 paragraph compare and contrast essay format. 
        This will allow both readers and watchers to get information on a game to decide whether it’s worth purchasing and playing or not.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My taget audience is people who have not yet purchased the video game.
        I will specifically be targeting male and female individuals in the teen
        and young adult age group. However the reviews will still be useful for most age groups

        Our mission is to review lesser-known video games with the intent to inform the viewer or reader about a potential video game to play. We will cover the basic premise behind the games story (if a story exists). We want readers or viewers to understand the full state of the game. Our reviews will touch on known bugs or issues with the current state of the game. We will touch on how well it fulfils the intended niche. Allowing our readers to gain a better understanding of the game will help their overall satisfaction with their purchase.

      <h3>Risk Of Rain 2</h3>
      <p>
        Risk of Rain 2 is a third-person roguelike game. It is playable as single player or multiplayer. The basic premise of Risk of Rain 2 is to destroy enemies on each level to earn gold. The gold is used to open chests that are randomly dispersed throughout the level. Items within the chests are also random. There are almost 150 unique items as well as equipment that can be found. The effects of the items stack based on the number of each item collected on a single run. Runs are the best way to describe the objective of this game. With 14 different “survivors” to choose from, random enemy spawns, and random items, each playthrough will be a unique experience. The objective for each run is up to the player. They may choose to continuously play through the game until death or amass as many items as possible before attempting to defeat one of the endgame bosses. Starting out the game only 2 survivors are unlocked. The other 12 survivors are unlocked by completing certain challenges during playthroughs. These challenges range from defeating a certain boss, to holding certain equipment for a specified duration. One unique feature of this game is the difficulty system that is implemented. During the character selection, the player may choose 1 of 3 difficulties: easy, normal, or hard. Once the player has begun the playthrough a meter like bar in the top corner will begin to move. As time passes, the bar will cause the difficulty of the game to increase. The amount of time between increases is determined by the initial difficulty setting chosen in the character selection menu. The difficulty determines what kinds of enemy’s spawn in the level, the health of the enemies, and the number of enemies that spawn in at a given time. I frequently found early bosses of a run eventually become “normal” enemies in later levels.       </p>

      <h3>The Binding of Isaac</h3>
      <p>
        The binding of Isaac is a top-down Legend of Zelda dungeon style roguelike. The introduction video paints a bleak picture of a child abused by his mother. His mother is overly religious to the point of being insane. One day she hears a voice demanding a sacrifice to prove her faith. Isaac escapes into the basement where the players journey begins. Levels, Items, and enemies are all randomly generated to create a never repeating experience. As items are collected the appearance of Isaac changes accordingly. Playthroughs can sometimes become difficult due to the players personal greed. Doors that injure players but have valuable loot inside create a risk vs. reward dichotomy. Players will debate whether they should hold onto as much health as possible for the boss fight or take damage to become stronger and more easily defeat a boss.
