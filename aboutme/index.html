    <h2>Cody Karl</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Cody. I was born in Puerto Rico and have moved all over the U.S. growing up. No my family was not in the military,<br>
        my dad worked in construction as a project manager and caused us to move wherever the projects were. I currently live in <br>
        Utah. I have been married 4 years now and have 2 kids. 
    </p>
    <p>I have a bachelors degree in Biology that I received from BYU Hawaii. I don't use the degree because my current job pays<br> 
        more. I work at Hill Air Force Base as a civilian C-130 mechanic. While it is a steady job, and fairly easy, I want more<br>
        out of life and can't see much further progression in my current field. I am working on the BS of Applied Technology to<br> 
        improve my knowledge of programming to one day create my own marketable program to distribute. 
    </p>
    <p>I love hiking and adventuring outdoors although it has been a while since I've had chance to do either. I look forward to<br>
        learning many knew and exciting things about website design and development from this course. 
    </p>
